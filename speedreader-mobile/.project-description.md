# SPEED READER AI - PROJECT MANIFESTO

# avoid fixating on single words 
# later handle "." in RSVP and wait a bit before moving to next word
# add "auto question mode" 

## Project Vision
Speed Reader is a premium mobile application designed to enhance reading speed using RSVP, Bionic Reading, and Chunking methods. The unique value proposition is AI-integrated visualization: generating 1 cinematic image via Flux.1-Schnell API every 300 words to maintain user engagement.

## 1. Project Identity
- **Goal:** Transform reading into a cinematic experience.
- **Core Loop:** Speed Reading (RSVP/Bionic) -> AI Summarization -> Flux.1 Image Generation.
- **Key Feature:** Live News Integration (Fetching, Summarizing, and Speed-Reading daily news).

## 2. Technical Stack (Strict)
- **Framework:** React Native + Expo (Managed Workflow).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS via NativeWind.
- **Icons:** Lucide-React-Native.
- **Animations:** Reanimated 3.
- **Image API:** SiliconFlow (Flux.1-Schnell).

## 3. Design System: 'Deep Nebula'
- **Aesthetic:** 'Deep Nebula' (Futuristic & Premium)
- **Background:** Pure OLED Black (#000000)
- **Primary Accent:** Electric Cyan (#00FFFF) - for progress and active states.
- **Secondary Accent:** Cyber Violet (#8A2BE2) - for AI features and milestones.
- **Components:** Bento Box layout, 24px corner radius, glassmorphism overlays (1px frosted borders).
- **Typography:** 'Inter' (UI), 'Playfair Display' or Serif (Reading Content).

## 4. Development Rules
- Use Functional Components with Hooks.
- Styles must be externalized or handled via NativeWind classes.
- Every reading mode component must support WPM (Words Per Minute) scaling.
- Keep components modular (ReadingEngine, NewsCard, AIBridge).
