## 5. Training Lab (Neuro-Ocular Conditioning)
Goal: To optimize the physiological and cognitive mechanisms of reading through evidence-based vision therapy and neuro-plasticity drills.

- **5.1. Kinetic Warm-up Drills (Muscle Pre-conditioning)**
Objective: To reduce ciliary muscle strain and improve extraocular muscle flexibility to prevent "Digital Eye Strain".

- **5.1.1. Dynamic Schulte Table (Attentional Stability):**

Academic Basis: Proven to improve visual search speed and stability of attention by forcing the brain to process a wide visual field simultaneously.

Mechanism: A 5x5 randomized grid where the user finds numbers 1–25 while keeping their gaze fixed strictly on the center point.

Gamification: Leveling up introduces "Distraction Modes" (pulsing colors) or "Rotating Grids" to test attentional blink.

- **5.1.2. Ocular Flexibility (The Infinity Stretch):**

Academic Basis: Uses the "Follow the Target" method to improve smooth pursuit movements and flexibility of the six extraocular muscles.

Mechanism: A glowing Electric Cyan node moves in a complex "Lazy 8" (Infinity) pattern. The user follows it to the extreme corners of the screen to maximize the range of motion.

- **5.2. Cognitive Focus Games (Perceptual Processing)**
Objective: To widen the "Perceptual Span"—the amount of text the brain can recognize in a single fixation.

- **5.2.1. Parafoveal Vision Catch (Span Expansion):**

Academic Basis: Research indicates that speed readers utilize "Parafoveal Processing" to pre-process upcoming words. This drill expands the visual span beyond the foveal center.

Mechanism: While the user focuses on a central anchor, words flash briefly in the peripheral margins. The user must identify the word or its length without moving their eyes away from the center.

- **5.2.2. Precision Saccadic Control (The Anti-Regression Drill):**

Academic Basis: Saccades are rapid eye movements between fixations. This drill trains "Return Sweeps" (moving from the end of one line to the start of the next) and minimizes "Regressions" (involuntary backtracking).

Mechanism: Two Cyber Violet nodes pulse at rhythmic intervals. The user must "jump" their gaze between them instantly with 0% overshoot or undershoot, mimicking the movement of efficient line-skipping.


- ## Training lab TASK 1: Create a reusable component named InfoButton.tsx. It should be a small, semi-transparent circle with an 'i' icon (using lucide-react-native). 2. Create an AcademicModal.tsx using react-native-modal or a simple Modal component. 3. Modal Design: Use the Deep Nebula style. The modal should have a glassmorphism background, a 'Why this works' title in Cyber Violet, a concise academic summary text, and a 'Learn More' button that opens a browser link (using expo-linking). 4. Logic: The InfoButton should accept title, description, and researchLink as props. 5. Implementation: Integrate this button into the top-right corner of the Schulte Table and Saccadic Jumps screens. Ensure the text is formatted professionally to build authority.
